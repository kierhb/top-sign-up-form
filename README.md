# Project: Sign-up Form
This project is intended to give you a chance to flex some of the new items you’ve been absorbing over the past few lessons. This time it’s a sign-up form for an imaginary service. The first project for [Intermediate HTML and CSS Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css) at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
